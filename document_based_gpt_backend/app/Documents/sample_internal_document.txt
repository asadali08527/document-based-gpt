I am a creative and versatile geek with extensive experience in developing and delivering high-impact software solutions across various domains. I am a  technical author at  Geeks For Geeks( https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/asadaliasad/articles)  &  Geekflare(https://geekflare.com/author/asad/). I played a pivotal role in the release of the WOO App (a dating application), which garnered three million active users within six months. My journey also includes developing a comprehensive full-stack application for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to facilitate Micro & Small Consumer Loans, Agent Loans, and Device/Handset Loans. Additionally, I designed a robust Generic KYC module to streamline customer onboarding processes for NBFC services. I also spearheaded the development of a full-stack application for vehicle/motor insurance companies to enhance their vehicle inspection and claims processes.

	In my recent role as a Lead Technical Consultant for Johnson Matthey through Fintark Limited, I led the design and implementation of the Trade Order Management System (TOMS) and Metal Transfer solutions, ensuring alignment with business requirements and industry best practices. TOMS is a sophisticated software solution that automates and optimizes the order management process within the financial trading domain. It efficiently handles various order types, including limit orders, reference orders, and Requests for Quotes, providing traders with a reliable platform to manage their trading activities.

	I am a passionate developer with a deep love for a blend of technologies such as Java, Python, Spring, Fast API, Flask, DJango, Go, Jenkins, Memcached, Kafka, Redis, AWS, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes. My expertise extends to the fields of data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), where I have utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis, modeling, and machine learning tasks.

	Moreover, I have a strong interest and experience in generative AI, Transformers, and various large language models (LLMs). I have worked with different LLM models and utilized Hugging Face libraries to customize, fine-tune, and evaluate these models to meet specific business needs. My diverse experience spans working as a backend developer for multiple companies, where I have consistently delivered value through my innovative solutions and collaborative approach. I firmly believe that both the organizations I have worked for and I have mutually benefited from my contributions.
